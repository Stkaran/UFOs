# UFOs

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a webpage that could display the data we have gathered on UFOs in a more dynamic way. This is accomplished by adding multiple filters the user can choose from including date, city, state, and country in order to refine their search. 

## Results
As shown below, we created a search box that allows the user to filter through the data with a multitude of choices. They can use only just one option, or all of the them depending on what they are looking for. In each box, there is example text to ensure the users will know what to put in each box to have a successful search.

To the right of the filter box is the the data is displayed in an easy to read table. Then, if the user finds an area they want to focus on, they can go back to the filter box to further refine their search. If they want to reset the table, they just need to click on the UFO Sightings text in the top left of the page in order to refresh the filter options.

## Summary
This largest issue with this setup is that the website displaying data from a very limited pool, so if the user for example doesn't know the date range of the data, they will not be able to make successful search. This can be resolved by a quick look the unfiltered table, but from a new user perspective, it is unintuitive. In order to enhance the user experience, a few changes could be made. First, one letter out of place will lead to a failed search. It may help to implement a way for the filter to return a result even if there is a spelling error. Also, one of the table columns does not have filter box : duration. Adding a filter for this option would give the user even more options when trying to parse throught the data.
